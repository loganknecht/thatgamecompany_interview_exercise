Providing meaningful ways for players around the world to connect to each other is one of our core goals here at TGC. As more complicated online experiences become available, we think more people will be looking for a short simple experience to share with others. The perfect overlap of these two requirements is a multiplayer Clicker game which we would like you to build!

- Create and host a multiplayer "clicker" game where:
- You can log in with a username that is associated with your account data.
- You “click” something every few seconds to earn some currency.
- You can see in real-time the stats of other players that are playing at the same time.
- You can spend your coins on a gift for another person who is online. They should see that you bought them a gift and should be able to reciprocate.
- It supports about a thousand concurrent users

Don't spend too much time on the user interface, it can be anything. An ugly html page, console application, etc. As long as we can run it, it can display the state of things, and communicate with your backend and API. You should provide some way for us to stress test your servers by simulating clients.

We are looking for you to impress us with the technical execution of your own solution. Consider adjusting your design if you believe you would be creating more dependencies than you need.

Expect to discuss with us how you would address issues of your system at the scale of a few tens or hundreds of thousands of users: the issues you could run into, how the implementation could be exploited and how you might resolve those concerns.

We prefer you spend no more than a few solid days of work on the test.  We would like you to complete the test within 2 weeks (not including the Holidays), but we are flexible with the submission time if you think that won’t be enough time or have other commitments.

Please let us know if you have any questions, you're welcome to contact us as much as necessary for clarification purposes. We're looking forward to seeing what you come up with and have fun!
